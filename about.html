                    <p>Hi! My name is Tanushri & I'm currently a 10th grade student in Orchids The International School.
                    I'm an outgoing and an energetic person. I strive to stay ahead by learning new things every day and 
                    pushing myself to do my best in all of my classes. I'm passionate about learning and I am especially 
                    interested in Math and Science. In my free time, I love to read, write, and explore different cultures.
                    I'm also an avid photographer, and I love to capture special moments in my life. I'm always looking for
                    new ways to express myself and to discover things about the world. And coming back to my school it's a 
                    great place to learn and make friends. It's a safe and supportive environment for students to grow. 
                    The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming, and the faculties are always willing to help. My school fosters
                    a sense of community and a spirit of collaboration. It has a strong curriculum and excellent teachers 
                    who help students reach their potential. My school as well promotes respect for diversity among its 
                    students and staff. My school also offers a wide range of extracurricular activities like sports, music, 
                    dance, DIY programs, robotics and so on.. I'm proud to be a part such a wonderful learning environment.</p>
